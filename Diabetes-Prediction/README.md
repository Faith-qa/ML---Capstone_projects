# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Project Description

This project focuses on building a classification model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health-related features. The dataset used comprises health and demographic data of 100,000 individuals, with 15 features available for analysis. The objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately assess the risk of diabetes using these features.

## Dataset

The dataset includes a wide range of health and demographic attributes. Each feature has been analyzed, and the best ones have been selected for model training. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Data Pipeline

The data pipeline involves several steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and erroneous data entries.
2. **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features that contribute to the prediction of diabetes.
3. **Data Normalization:** Scaling the features to ensure they are on a similar scale for better model performance.
4. **Model Training:** Using various machine learning algorithms to train the model, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the model's parameters to achieve the best performance.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Cross-validation was employed to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability to unseen data.

## Outcome

The final model, a Voting Classifier, achieved an accuracy of approximately 97.19% on the test samples with the best hyperparameters found. This indicates a high level of accuracy in predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on the selected health-related features.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the ability to predict diabetes risk using machine learning techniques. The model's high accuracy underscores the importance of feature selection and hyperparameter tuning in achieving optimal predictive performance.

## Future Work

Future enhancements to this project could include:

- Incorporating additional features or datasets to improve prediction accuracy.
- Exploring advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning models.
- Implementing the model in a real-world application for healthcare providers to assess diabetes risk.
